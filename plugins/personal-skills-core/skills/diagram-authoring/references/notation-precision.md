# Notation precision — drawing rules & geometry self-checks

Load at diagram-authoring Step 4. Theory anchor: D. Moody, "The 'Physics' of
Notations" (IEEE Trans. Software Engineering, 2009) — nine evidence-based
principles for cognitively effective visual notations; principle names appear
in parentheses so the source stays traceable (list verified by web search
2026-08-27).

## 1. Symbol discipline

- One symbol = one meaning across the WHOLE deliverable, and one meaning =
  one symbol (semiotic clarity). No symbol overload between figures of the
  same doc — if a rounded box is "state" in one figure it is not "process"
  in the next.
- A legend becomes mandatory the moment a second node or edge type exists;
  it lists every type actually used, no more. Keep distinct symbol count
  ≤ ~6 per diagram (graphic economy); over that, split the view or encode
  with labels instead of new shapes.
- Never encode by color alone — pair color with shape, line style, or an
  icon (dual coding); grayscale printing and color-vision deficiency both
  break color-only. Text labels complement, never replace, the visual
  variable.
- Distinct types differ on ≥2 visual variables (shape+color, shape+border)
  so they stay tellable at small size (perceptual discriminability, visual
  expressiveness).
- Prefer shapes that hint their meaning — cylinder = store, slotted bar =
  queue, stick figure = actor (semantic transparency) — but the hint never
  substitutes for the legend.

## 2. Layout discipline

- One axis, one meaning, stated once per figure: "time flows left→right",
  "dependencies point downward", "layers stack top→down". Never two
  meanings on one axis (cognitive fit).
- ≤ 7±2 primary elements per view level; over that, promote to a hierarchy
  level with boundary reconciliation (complexity management — the
  reconciliation CHECK lives in view-integrity-checks.md §1).
- Multi-view deliverables carry navigation cues: identical element names,
  plus a locator ("this figure zooms block X of fig. 1") (cognitive
  integration).
- Grid snap — pick one unit (8px SVG / 0.125in PPTX) for positions AND
  sizes; siblings share dimensions unless a size difference carries
  meaning.
- Orthogonal edge routing for block/architecture diagrams; crossing target
  0, declare when >3 are forced; an edge never passes THROUGH a node;
  parallel edges keep uniform spacing.
- Labels horizontal; never overlapping edges or other labels (asserted in
  §4); edge labels sit at the midpoint or at the owning port.
- Minimum rendered font ≥ 11px at 100% zoom for body labels; text contrast
  ≥ 4.5:1 against the actual fill behind it (WCAG AA; the archdiag palette
  is checked by `tools/archdiag/tokens.mjs --check`).
- Role type ramp — one size per text ROLE, stated once per figure and
  taken from the carrier's size preset (carrier-playbook.md §Size
  presets): audit view 13 / 11 / 11 / 12 (title / sub-line / edge pill /
  container title); presentational 15 / 11.5 / 11 / 12+ (name / role /
  edge label / status marker). A size that appears once is a mistake or a
  new role — name the role or remove the size.
- Monospace only for LITERALS the reader would type or grep — a path, a
  flag, a command, an id; a name is not a literal, and body text never
  goes mono. Evidence anchors (`ev`) are literals; node titles are not.
- CJK body floor by carrier: ≥ 11px on desktop HTML (measured: every
  accepted audit and owner view), ≥ 12px/pt on projected or printed
  carriers [assumed — borrowed guidance, uncalibrated until a deck render
  passes the user's gate]. Width estimates are per code point: `cjkW`
  (emit.mjs) counts a character above U+00FF as one em and anything else
  as 0.55 em — confirmed 2026-09-05; the in-page bbox is the truth, the
  estimate only places pills.

## 3. Per-notation conventions

- **Block / C4 / exploded**: ports drawn ON the boundary; when interface
  identity matters, edges attach to ports, not to arbitrary box points.
  Exploded product views: numbered callouts, ONE level of explosion per
  figure, parent silhouette/locator kept visible.
- **FSM / statechart**: initial marker + terminal ring; transition labels
  `event [guard] / action`; self-transitions loop outside the node;
  history/parallel notation only together with the prose semantics note
  (view-integrity-checks §1).
- **Sequence**: lifelines equally spaced; activation bars shown (or their
  omission declared); async vs sync arrowheads distinct — and the legend
  says so; the scenario name is in the title. In a mixed deliverable
  (sequence beside structural views) whole-deliverable symbol consistency
  (§1) outranks this notation's arrowhead convention: keep the
  deliverable's own sync/async encoding and declare the deviation in the
  legend (F2 2026-08-28).
- **DFD / pipeline**: uniform flow direction; stores/externals visually
  distinct from processes; error flows dashed AND colored (dual coded).
- **Timing**: shared time axis with units and tick marks; every constraint
  arrow carries value + tolerance.
- **Dense diagrams — numbered-chip labels** (adopted from field test FT-2):
  when on-canvas edge labels would collide (a §4 label assert fails, or
  clearly will), replace edge text with small numbered chips colored per
  edge type, placed at collision-free points, and carry the full contracts
  in a numbered table beside the diagram. The canvas stays clean, the
  contract stays complete, and chips stay checkable (§4).

## 4. Geometry self-checks (machine rung — run before any pixel claim)

For SVG/HTML carriers, run in-page JS (browser-pane protocol: these are DOM
reads, no screenshots involved):

- every label `getBBox()` disjoint from every other label bbox (padding ≥2px);
- every edge endpoint within ε (2px) of its declared node/port anchor;
- union of all element bboxes ⊆ viewBox (nothing clipped);
- declared grid honored: snapped x/y ≡ 0 (mod grid unit);
- no edge segment passes THROUGH a solid node it does not terminate on —
  segment×rect intersection test, containers and the edge's own endpoints
  exempt (added 2026-08-27: endpoint anchoring alone missed a pass-through
  that only the appearance rung caught — the assert set itself needs the
  calibration the §2 rule implies);
- font-size ≥ the §2 minimum; text/fill contrast ≥ 4.5:1;
- numbered chips (when used, §3) disjoint from every non-container node rect;
- every `url(#id)` reference (arrow markers above all) resolves to a defined
  element in the same document — a browser drops a dangling reference
  SILENTLY, so the symptom is a missing glyph that no geometry assert
  measures and the human gate reliably misses (F1 v1.0 2026-08-28: 56
  undefined arrowhead references passed both machine rungs AND user
  acceptance; found only when F2 reused the framework). Calibrate with a
  positive control: remove one def, the check must fire. The general move:
  a presence-of-glyph appearance property gets CONVERTED into a DOM
  reference assert whenever the carrier allows, not left to the eye.

For PPTX: shape coordinates are deterministic EMU values from the build
script — assert the same invariants on the script's data BEFORE writing the
file, then one rendered-thumbnail check for appearance.

A failed assert is a layout bug to fix, not a note to ship. These asserts
prove geometry only — the human appearance gate (SKILL.md Step 5.3) still
applies after them.

**Diagnostic output format** (B-1): failures are emitted as diagnostic
objects, not bare strings — `{code, subject, evidence, supportedFixes}`:
a stable kebab-case code (`label-overlap`, `edge-through-node`,
`anchor-off-node`, …), the exact elements affected, the measured values
proving the violation, and ≥1 concrete suggested fix with coordinates when
computable ("move label to (330,114) or dy +24"). A diagnostic the repairer
can act on without re-deriving the geometry is the point; "label overlap:
A × B" alone is not a finished diagnostic — and neither is a bare count:
a crossing check reports WHICH pair at WHICH point, never just "1 found"
(F1 2026-08-28: a count-only crossing diagnostic forced a manual hunt for
the pair).

**Instrument preconditions** (B-6; extended after field run F1 2026-08-28):
the assert set compares `getBBox()` rectangles in ONE untransformed
coordinate space — no `transform` on any element inside the asserted scene
(the pan/zoom wrapper itself exempt), or every bbox is mapped through its
CTM first. And the content must actually RENDER when measured: `getBBox()`
on `display:none` content returns zero rects, so a tabbed/multi-view
deliverable measures in a temporary all-views-rendered mode and asserts
each scene's bbox is non-zero before trusting any rectangle. Assert both
preconditions themselves: the checker's first run produced 36 false
overlaps from one transformed legend group, its second deliverable 987
from hidden tab panes — a checker wrong in bulk is an instrument fault,
not a layout fault (gate-calibration rule). Third precondition (external
validation 2026-09-02): a text `getBBox()` includes the font's leading,
and that height varies by family (~7% between Segoe UI and Noto Sans TC;
macOS CJK fallbacks sit at the tall end) — so a label-clearance PASS is a
fact about the FONT THAT MEASURED, not about the bytes. Design label
spacing with headroom (gap ≥ PAD + the metric spread, measured ≈ +1.5px),
and make the report carry a render receipt (engine, DPR, computed
font-family, and a measured bbox-height/font-size ratio as the metric
fingerprint); a PASS without the receipt is not comparable across
environments. The failure this rule closes: a 18px title→subtitle
baseline distance left 0.63px of margin under Segoe UI and passed every
local gate, then reported 44 overlaps in an external Chromium — the same
one-sided calibration class as the 56 dangling markers. Never widen the
padding or exempt "designed" pairs to make such a report pass; fix the
spacing (user ruling 2026-09-02).

**Repair order & bounded repair** (B-2): fix in this order, re-running the
asserts after every edit — (1) model/schema errors, (2) node overlap /
out-of-canvas, (3) edge-through-node + endpoint anchoring, (4) crossings,
shared corridors, route rhythm, (5) label clearances. Per diagnostic at
most 2 focused repair rounds; if two consecutive rounds do not reduce the
failure count, stop and report the unresolved diagnostics truthfully.
Never delete a semantic label (contract, direction, protocol, sync/async)
to pass a check — a label may be dropped only with an argument that both
endpoints fully imply it, stated in the delivery note.

## Provenance

Distilled 2026-08-27 from Moody 2009 — nine principles: semiotic clarity,
perceptual discriminability, semantic transparency, complexity management,
cognitive integration, visual expressiveness, dual coding, graphic economy,
cognitive fit (verified via web search 2026-08-27) — plus standard UML/C4
drawing practice. 2026-08-28: §4 diagnostic format, instrument
preconditions, and repair order adopted from tt-a1i/archify (MIT); borrow
ledger B-1/B-2/B-6 + field evidence in
`outputs/skill-reviews/archify-integration-analysis-2026-08-28.md`.
2026-08-28 (F2 field round): §4 reference-resolution check (F1 v1.0
dangling-marker incident) and §3 sequence consistency-precedence note.
Review-when: a carrier appears whose geometry cannot be
asserted (e.g. hand-drawn import) — add its verification story there or
refuse precision claims on it.
