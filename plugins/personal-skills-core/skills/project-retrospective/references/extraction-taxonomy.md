# Extraction Taxonomy

Use this table to classify items flagged during conversation scan. Each category includes a description, typical dialogue signals, and output format.

---

## Conversation scan signals (used by SKILL.md Step 1 item 7)

**High-value signals (always extract)**
- User says "no", "redo", "that's not what I meant" → log the root cause of the misunderstanding
- User says "use this", "this is better", "let's go with X" → log the decision outcome
- Claude went in the wrong direction and was corrected → log the correct path
- A term or concept appears repeatedly → log the definition
- A direction was explicitly abandoned with a reason → log the rejected option

**Medium-value signals (extract when present)**
- User adds "oh, and one more thing..." → often signals a key constraint
- A tool or API error appeared and was resolved → log the pitfall and workaround
- User expressed a preference about format, tone, or pacing

**Low-value signals (skip or summarize briefly)**
- Pure small talk or off-topic exchanges
- Standard procedures already documented elsewhere

---

## Category 1: Technical Decisions

**What to include**
- Which technical approach was chosen and why
- Which approaches were explicitly rejected and why
- Architectural forks ("we discussed X vs Y, went with Y")

**Typical dialogue signals**
- "Let's go with X because..."
- "Don't use Y, we tried it and hit Z"
- "This makes more sense because..."

**Output format**
```markdown
### Decision: [topic]
- **Chosen**: [final choice]
- **Reason**: [why]
- **Rejected option(s)**: [X], because [reason]
- **Context**: [conditions under which this decision holds]
```

---

## Category 2: Pitfalls & Bugs

**What to include**
- Traps in tools, packages, or APIs and how to work around them
- Wrong assumptions that led to wasted effort
- Version compatibility or environment setup issues
- Repeated mistakes Claude made in this conversation

**Typical dialogue signals**
- An error appeared and a fix was found
- "No, you did it again..." (Claude repeated a mistake)
- "This has a bug", "this doesn't work"

**Output format**
```markdown
### Pitfall: [short description]
- **Symptom**: [when/how you hit this]
- **Root cause**: [why it happens]
- **Fix/workaround**: [how to resolve]
- **Prevention**: [how to avoid next time]
- **Cost**: [rounds/time actually lost — be honest: "30 seconds but hit twice"
  and "two rounds chasing the wrong cause" are different animals]
- **Times hit**: [how many times in this project — feeds `the project's recorded lessons`'s `hits:` field]
- **Status**: [fixed / worked around / accepted — an accepted one is not a
  failure to report, but it must not be written as if it were solved]
```

Cost and times-hit are what let a reader (and Step 6.2's gate d) rank pitfalls —
without them, a two-round trap and a thirty-second annoyance look identical.

## Category 3: Effective Workflows

**What to include**
- Task decomposition patterns that worked ("do A before B")
- Prompt patterns that produced better outputs
- Steps that required human confirmation and couldn't be automated
- Particularly effective tool combinations

**Typical dialogue signals**
- User proactively broke down the task ("first show me X, then...")
- Output quality improved after user requested a specific format
- "This is faster", "let's always do it this way"

**Output format**
```markdown
### Workflow: [topic]
- **Approach**: [concrete steps or sequence]
- **When to use**: [applicable scenarios]
- **Why it works**: [underlying reason]
- **Caveats**: [exceptions or limitations]
```

---

## Category 4: Project Constraints & Context

**What to include**
- Hard limits that cannot be changed (technical or business constraints)
- Project-specific term definitions ("in this project, X means Y")
- Stakeholder restrictions or preferences
- Environment specifics (pinned versions, target platform)

**Typical dialogue signals**
- "We can't use X because..."
- "In our context, X means..."
- "That can't be changed, it's an external constraint"

**Output format**
```markdown
### Constraint: [topic]
- **Limit**: [what it is specifically]
- **Reason**: [why this limit exists]
- **Impact**: [which decisions this constraint shaped]

### Term Definitions
| Term | Meaning in this project | Notes |
|------|------------------------|-------|
| X    | Y                      | ...   |
```

---

## Category 5: User Preferences

**What to include**
- Output format preferences ("no bullets, give me prose")
- Tone preferences ("cut to the conclusion, skip the preamble")
- Working rhythm ("give me a draft first, I'll revise" vs "get it right first try")
- Confirmation habits ("check with me before each step")

**Typical dialogue signals**
- User revised Claude's output format and said "this is better"
- "Always do it this way", "I like this approach"
- User corrected the same type of formatting issue repeatedly

**Output format**
```markdown
### Preference: [category]
- **Preference**: [specific description]
- **Anti-pattern**: [what this user dislikes]
- **Scope**: [universal preference, or only in specific contexts]
```

---

## Category 6: Reusable Principles

**What to include**
- General principles that apply beyond this project
- Judgment rules derived from this project's experience
- Behavioral guidelines worth passing to future Claude instances

**Test**: If you moved this rule to a completely different project, would it still be useful? If yes, it goes here.

**Output format**
```markdown
### Principle: [topic]
- **Rule**: [concrete, actionable description]
- **Source**: [which experience this was derived from]
- **Applies when**: [conditions under which this rule holds]
- **Exceptions**: [when not to apply it]
```

---

## Category 7: The Clean Path (forward-looking)

**What to include**
- The build order you would follow if you started this project again, with a
  GATE per step ("do not proceed until X passes")
- The selection table: component → what was chosen → why → under what condition
  to re-choose
- Which decisions are load-bearing (change them and everything downstream
  changes) vs cheap

**Test**: Categories 1–6 answer "what happened". This one answers "what would I
do next time". If the project is one of a recurring KIND (a CLI, a scraper, a
desktop agent), this section is usually the most valuable output of the whole
retrospective — and it is the one a purely backward-looking taxonomy loses.

**Output format**
```markdown
### Clean path: [project kind]
0. [step] → gate: [what must be true before step 1]
1. [step] → gate: [...]
...

### Selection table
| Component | Chosen | Why | Re-choose when |
|-----------|--------|-----|----------------|
```

**Caveat**: only write this when the project is an instance of a repeatable
kind. A one-off has no clean path worth generalizing — say so rather than
inventing one.
