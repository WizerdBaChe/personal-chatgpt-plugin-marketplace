# Mode C — Detection & Response Readiness Audit

Premise (blue-team reality): prevention eventually fails; the differentiating
questions are how fast a compromise is DETECTED (MTTD) and RESPONDED to (MTTR).
This mode audits whether the system produces the signals a defender would need
and whether anyone/anything would act on them. For a solo-developer or small
project, "SIEM" scales down to "centralized logs + a few alerts + a written
what-if note" — audit proportionally, don't demand a SOC.

## 1. Security event logging (A09:2025 — Logging & Alerting Failures)

Are the security-decisive events recorded at all? Minimum set:

- Authentication: login success/failure, lockouts, MFA events, password/
  credential changes, token issuance and revocation.
- Authorization: DENIED access attempts (failed authz is attacker telemetry),
  privilege/role changes, admin-function use.
- Data: access/export of sensitive records (bulk reads especially), deletion
  and modification of critical data.
- System: config changes, dependency/deployment changes, service start/stop,
  security-control state changes (e.g. a validation layer disabled).
- Input rejections: validation failures and malformed-request spikes — early
  probe signature.

Each event needs: timestamp (synced clock/timezone), actor identity, source
(IP/session), action, target, outcome. A log line that can't answer "who did
what to what, from where, and did it work" won't support an investigation.

## 2. Log hygiene (logs must not become the leak)

- **No secrets/PII in logs**: passwords (including failed-login attempted
  passwords), tokens, session IDs, full card/ID numbers, private keys — grep
  log statements and error handlers for sensitive fields (pairs with Mode A §6
  data classification). Logs are usually the least-protected copy of data.
- **Log injection**: user-controlled strings written raw can forge lines or
  break parsers — encode/escape newlines and control chars.
- **Tamper resistance**: logs shipped off-host (or at least append-only /
  separately permissioned) so the attacker — or insider (Mode B §6) — can't
  edit their own trail; retention long enough to investigate an incident
  discovered late (breaches are often found months in).
- **Volume sanity**: log storms (retry loops, repeated errors) can drown
  signals and fill disks — that's an availability finding too (Mode A §7).

## 3. Alerting & abuse-rate controls (detection engineering, scaled down)

Logging without alerting is forensics-only — A09:2025's rename to "Logging &
ALERTING Failures" is exactly this point:

- **Alert-worthy conditions defined**: brute-force pattern (N failed logins),
  logins from new geography/impossible travel where relevant, privilege
  escalation, mass data export, error-rate spikes, integrity-check failures.
  For small systems even an email/webhook on the top 3 conditions beats zero.
- **Rate limiting exists and is observable**: login/OTP endpoints, expensive
  queries, public APIs — limits enforced server-side, and LIMIT HITS are logged
  (a tripped rate limit is a detection event, not just a 429).
- **Someone receives it**: an alert channel nobody reads is a finding; name the
  receiving human/rotation, even if it's just the owner's inbox.
- **Baseline & anomaly awareness** (mature setups): normal traffic/behavior
  baselined so deviations (odd hours, odd volumes, odd endpoints) are
  detectable; MITRE ATT&CK can serve as the coverage map for which attacker
  behaviors have any detection at all.

## 4. Monitoring coverage & blind spots

- **Coverage across tiers**: app logs alone miss the OS/network layer; host
  metrics alone miss app-level abuse. List which tiers (app / host / network /
  cloud control plane) emit anything, and name the blind spots explicitly.
- **Centralization**: logs aggregated somewhere queryable across sources —
  correlating an attack across 5 machines by hand-ssh is not a capability.
- **Health of the monitoring itself**: would anyone notice if logging stopped
  (agent died, disk full, misconfigured shipper)? Silent monitoring death is a
  classic pre-incident condition.
- **Third-party/dependency signals**: security advisories for the stack reach
  the owner somehow (mailing list, bot) — pairs with Mode B §2 update policy.

## 5. Incident-response readiness

Scaled to the organization — for a solo project this is a one-page note, but it
must exist BEFORE the incident:

- **Playbook**: for the top realistic scenarios (credential leak, data breach,
  defacement/malware, ransomware/data loss), who does what first? Includes the
  decision of when to take the system offline.
- **Containment levers inventoried**: can you actually rotate all secrets,
  invalidate all sessions, block an IP, disable a compromised account, roll
  back a deployment — and how long does each take? Untested levers count as
  half-existing.
- **Forensics-ready**: the logs from §1–§2 are sufficient to reconstruct "what
  did the attacker touch" — test by walking one hypothetical incident through
  the actual log fields.
- **Backups as security control**: backups exist, are versioned/offline enough
  to survive ransomware, and RESTORE has been tested (an unrestored backup is a
  hope, not a control).
- **Post-incident loop**: lessons feed back into Mode A/B checks and new §3
  alert conditions — detection engineering is iterative by nature.

## 6. AI agent actions — visibility and recovery

An agent's damage differs from an attacker's in one way that matters here: it
is fast, well-intentioned, and looks like normal work. §1-§5 are tuned for a
hostile actor; these are tuned for a trusted one that is wrong. Audit items —
designing the missing mechanism is a handoff to `ai-coding-guardrails`.

- **Intent is recoverable, not just the diff**: agent run transcripts
  (reasoning, tool calls, results) are retained. A diff shows what changed; only
  the transcript shows what it was TRYING to do, which is what tells you whether
  the rest of its work is also wrong.
- **Recovery verified ENABLED, in advance**: `git reflog` retention window,
  editor/IDE local history, and database PITR — check each is on TODAY. All
  three are worthless if switched on after the incident, and this is the single
  item most often assumed rather than verified. Distinct from §5's backup item:
  that one asks whether backups restore, this one asks whether the
  seconds-to-minutes undo paths exist at all.
- **Time-to-detect a wrong-but-plausible change**: what would surface a subtly
  incorrect agent commit that compiles and passes review, and how long after
  merge? If the honest answer is "when a user reports it", say so — that is the
  finding.
- **Loop circuit breaker**: is there a max-retry limit on an
  agent-fix → review → agent-fix cycle, or can it churn until someone notices?
  An unbounded loop burns budget and buries the original defect under edits.
- **Undo path for bulk operations**: agent-run mass edits (codemods, renames,
  migrations) are reversible as a unit — a single reverting commit, not
  file-by-file archaeology.
